"Biomedical problem: Meniscus regeneration, multiscale modeling of tissue phenomena. \\
        
	** Implement PDEs in FreeFem++ representing a nonwoven scaffold in a novel 3D printed perfusion chamber which is integrated in a bioreactor that allows in-vitro investigations of scaffolds in interaction with chondrocytes and adipose tissue-derived stem cells \\

        ** Sensitivity analysis of the parameters with model order reduction techniques (compared to real data)"
