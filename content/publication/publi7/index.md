abstract: We study the dynamics of a seeding experiment where a fibrous scaffold material is colonized by two types of cell populations. The specific application that we have in mind is related to the idea of meniscus tissue regeneration. In order to support the development of a promising replacement material, we discuss certain rate equations for the densities of human mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes and for the production of collagen-containing extracellular matrix. For qualitative studies, we start with a system of ordinary differential equations and refine then the model to include spatial effects of the underlying nonwoven scaffold structure. Numerical experiments as well as a complete set of parameters for future benchmarking are provided.
