abstract: We propose a continuous model for meniscus cartilage regeneration triggered by two populations of cells migrating and (de)differentiating within an artificial scaffold with a known structure. The described biological processes are influenced by a fluid flow and therewith induced deformations of the scaffold. Numerical simulations are done for the corresponding dynamics within a bioreactor which was designed for performing the biological experiments.
