I am an Assistant Professor in applied mathematics at [ENSTA Paris]("https://www.ensta-paris.fr").

My research interests include fluid mechanics, P.D.E analysis, numerical schemes, reduced order methods, and inverse problems.

I am currently developping a website on reduced basis methods: [link](https://reducedbasis.github.io).
